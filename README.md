# Black-Line-Follower
I have made a bot(car) which follows the black line. In this project I have used 5 IR sensors to sense the black line. When IR sensor is on Black line it gives output '1' else it give '0'.Through this logic i have programmed my motors using arduino uno accordingly so that it only follows the black line only.
